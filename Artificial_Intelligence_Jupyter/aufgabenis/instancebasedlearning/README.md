# 2nd Exercise - Intelligent Systems
This repository provides my solutions to the k-Meanclustering and k-Nearest-Neighbor-Classifier algorithms.

Both are illustrated using matplotlib.

k-Meansclustering is animated. Just click on the plot window. 

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy 
- (stylesheet)

## Stylesheet (optional)
I also provide my stylesheet, which I use for plots (standardstyle.mplstyle). For my OS (Linux) I put them in the following directories:
- standardstyle.mplstyle in ~/.config/matlotlib/stylelib/
- matplotlibrc.template in ~/.config/matplotlib/
