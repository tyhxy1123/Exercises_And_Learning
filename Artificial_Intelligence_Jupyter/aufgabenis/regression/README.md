# 4th Exercise on Regression and Gradient Descent
Provides my plot scripts for plotting gradients and wireframes. 
They are incomplete (mainly due to singularity for 3.a.i)) and probably won't be 
fixed by me. If you can fix it don't bother to start a pull request.

- Task 2: Linear Regression of the gasoline consumption problem.
- Task 3: Plotting of functions f(x, y) and gradients Df(x, y)
  - Especially plotting the function in i\) is tricky due to the singularity at (x, y) = (0, 0)
  - Additionally to 3D-plots, there are 2D-plots, which works around the arrow-head problem for 3D-Quiver-Plots.
